# ActivityReminder
Android basics course final assignment for [Tampere University of Applied Sciences](http://www.tamk.fi/web/tamken).

The app it self is in proof of concept state and needs some work to be actually usable.

This is my first android project so there must be some silly things going on. The app probably should be running on "main" device eg. phone or tablet and not the watch. It really should use Google Fit API instead of the built in pedometer.

Theres a report on [making this app](ActivityReminder/ActivityReminder_raportti.pdf ) (in finnish).
